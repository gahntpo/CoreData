# CoreData
Demo project for Core Data and SwiftUI 

I developed this app for a Youtube tutorial which you can watch here:
[How to Save and Manage Data with Core Data in Swift - SwiftUI Basics Tutorial 2023](https://youtu.be/nTcrzJ49m-U)

## MacOS App
The app works well on macOS. It uses Core Data to manage and save the user's data. You can filter on finished and open tasks. I also added a search text field.
